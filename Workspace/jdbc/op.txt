my review after using a week
pros awesome gaming performance
no lag what so ever camera is good
just use manual exposure
turbo charger charges really fast
no heating issues i have faced
those who talk about the heating issues are either haters or fakers
cons battery life is on the average side i would say
with moderate to little heavy usage it can last a day with a screen on time of 4hrs with 20 left
overall i feel its a great device for gamers and for casual users
just if they had improved battery to 3000 mah it would have been a perfect phone at least for me
well its actually my own first moto
ive used a lot of android devices
well i must say in this price range its something if u want a reliable brand and sturdy phone then u must go for this
the first thing comes to mind while buying and after reading other user review that the phone i am ordering is working well or not
so the answer luck
these are electronics and u just cant rely like that
thats where flipkart 30 days replacement helps in
so just go for it
i myself has replaced many products as they were not good at first time
an old flipkart customer from 2012
as of now all are working fine
now as u know in other reviews they write the pros
things i have not mentioned in cons are great in the phone
i will write just the cons 1high priced a bit 2 no usb cable in the box 3
only 2 gb though 64 is user available but still this price is high for only 2 gb ram 4 heats up on 4g but thats normal on all the other 4g phone while using 4g
rest no other cons i recommend to go for it if u want a reliable phone and brand
which gives fast charging and fully dust proof plus water proof at this price 40 minutes full charge
hi bought this is as my secondary phone black color
points those might be helpful to others in image you will see white phone has slight blueish back color
but you need to know is black also has same bluish color back
image of back color phone is not accurate on flipkart
side button are little loose
you can see them moving little up and down i am not sure if moto g3 also has same thing
i am giving 4 star because its not perfect but yes great deal in such amount
good points are performance is good
stock ui you will get feel of nexus software
no extra unwanted apps and software
design is decent
just got the device delivered this morning
unto now there has been nothing to complain about
impressive speaker volume is loud enough
multitasking seems really good
unbelievable fast charging really charges very quickly
battery seems good initial impression
note experienced heating on the back cover during initial use
but once i charged to 100 issue is gone
i was waiting for a dual sim 5 inch phone with expandable memory under
15k
moto g3 turbo was just the phone i was looking for and wasted no time in ordering one
im sharing my views on this phone after using for the last 4 days
i bought this one after exchanging my nexus 4 what i like about this phone
it has 16 gb internal and expandable up to 32gb thru microsd dedicated slot
so i get 48 gb in total
that is good enough for me
crisp display
my son who owns nexus 5 said its display is better than nexus 5sound quality is better and louder than nexus4 it has dual sim
this was the main reason to dispose of my nexus 4 it has swipe enabled google keyboard indian english as well as hinglishhindi keyboard
keyboard option can be changed easily without going to settings
takes decent photos
this phone is not making me miss my nexus 4 which i used for 2 years what i dont like about this phone
turbo charging i started charging when the phone reached red zone down to 10 charge
it took 29 min to reach 50 charge
another 90min to reach 100 charge
can we call this turbo charging
battery lasts for a day on an average 530am to 5pm with moderate use
i wish it lasted for 34 hours more
overall im happy with this phone
its really value for money
instead of buying an expensive phone which will not have much resale value after 12 years its better to buy phones like this
it wont disappoint you
moto g turbo is far better than moto g3
ordered this on 11 dec 15 and got this delivered on 12 dec 15
thanks to flipchart
coming to this phone pros good battery life lasts for 1 day with full 4g games and video
camera excellent both front and back
screen resolution is also very good
sound quality is excellent since speakers are on front side
cons nothing till now
overall value for money
close your eyes and go for it
well we all know about the pros and cons
the experience with the device is awesome
the only issue is heating
whenever it gets heated you can drop it in water since it is water resistant it will not run down and get cool quickly
good smart phone
but moto should give a competition to one plus
the product was well packed and delivered the next day of the order
loudspeaker is good
clear loud
battery is amazing only if you are using one sim
can last for 2 days at normal usage
incall hearing is good too
feels good in the hand
nice grip
with water resistance
camera quality is not that great though its 13mp
my nexus 5 does the better job done
over all the phone is great for day to day usage
looks great feels great
thank you
so i bought this mobile with in a day delivery and flipchart did a great job at that
the mobile itself is quite power packed with following pros fast boot twist wrist shake functions fast processing no lagging with heavy use for a 24 hrs
use rubber back case awesome grip curvy design guaranteed to get marshmallow pretty soon
cons camera not better
but overall am pretty satisfied with my purchase at this price
i received this before 2 days
here is my experiences with this product moto g turbo edition
build quality is very niceno
extra preloaded apps
camera is nice
if you want high quality result then buy professional camera
battery works fine if you are not a gamer
turbo charger can charge this moto in approx
15 to 2 hours
not lagging while playing games
cons it should come with data cable
head phones is not the best
display is not bright enough
but quality is fine
you have to download new launcher app to remove google search box from home screen
bottom line every mobile has one or more advantages and disadvantages
but if are quality lover go for it
