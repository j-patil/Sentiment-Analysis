my review after using a week prosawesome
gaming performance
no lag watsoevercamera is good
just use manual exposureturbo
charger charges really fastno
heating issues i have faced
those who talk abt the heating issues are either haters or fakers
consbattery life is on the average side i would saywith
moderate to little heavy usage it can last a day with a screen on time of 4hrs with 20 left
overall i feel its a great device for gamers and for casual usersjust
if they had improved battery to 3000 mah it would hv been a perfect phone atleast for me
well its actually my own first moto
ive used a lot of android devices
well i must say in this price range its something if u want a reliable brand and sturdy phone then u must go for this
the first thing comes to mind while buying and after reading other user review that the phone i am ordering is working well or not
so the answer luck
these are electronics and u just cant rely like that
thats y flipkart 30days replacement helps in
so just go for it
i myself has replaced many products as they were not good at first time
an old flipkart custmr frm 2012
as of now all are working fine
now as u know in other reviews they write the pros
things i have not mentioned in cons are great in the phone
i will write just the cons 1high priced a bit 2 no usb cable in the box 3
only 2gb though 64 is user available but still this price is high for only 2gb ram 4 heats up on 4g but thats normal on all the other 4g phone while using 4g
rest no other cons
i recommend to go for it if u want a reliable phone and brand
which gives fast charginh and fully dust proof plus water proof at this price
40minutes full charge
hi bought this is as my secondary phone black colorpoints those might be helpful to others in image you will see white phone has slight blueish back color
but you need to know is black also has same bluish color back
ie
image of back color phone is not accurate on flipkart
side button are little loose
you can see them moving little up and down i am not sure if moto g3 also has same thing
i am giving 4 star because its not prefect but yes great deal in such amountgood points areperformance is goodstock ui you will get feel of nexus softwareno extra unwanted apps and softwaredesign is decent
just got the device delivered this morning
unto now there has been nothing to complain about
impressivespeaker volume is loud enoughmultitasking seems really good unbelievable fast charging really charges very quicklybattery seems good initial impression noteexperienced heating on the back cover during initial use
but once i charged to 100 issue is gone
i was waiting for a dual sim 5 inch phone with expandable memory under 15k
moto g3 turbo edn was just the phone i was looking for and wasted no time in ordering one
im sharing my views on this phone after using for the last 4 days
i bought this one after exchanging my nexus 4 what i like about this phone
it has 16gb internal and expandable up to 32gb thru microsd dedicated slot
so i get 48gb in total
that is good enough for me
crisp display
my son who owns nexus 5 said its display is better than nexus 5sound quality is better and louder than nexus4 it has dual sim
this was the main reason to dispose off my nexus 4it has swipe enabled google keyboard indian english as well as hinglishhindi keyboard
keyboard option can be changed easily without going to settingstakes decent photosthis phone is not making me miss my nexus 4 which i used for 2 years what i dont like about this phone
turbo charging i started charging when the phone reached red zone down to 10 charge
it took 29 min to reach 50 charge
another 90min to reach 100 charge
can we call this turbo chargingbattery lasts for a day on an average 530am to 5pm with moderate use
i wish it lasted for 34 hrs more
overall im happy with this phone
its really value for money
instead of buying an expensive phone which will not have much resale value after 12 years its better to buy phones like this
it wont disappoint you
moto g turbo is far far better than moto g3
ordered this on 11 dec 15 and got this delivered on 12 dec 15
thanks to flipkart
coming to this phoneprosgood battery life lasts for 1 day with full 4g games videocamera excellent both front and backscreen resolution is also very goodsound quality is excellent since speakers are on front sideconsnothing till nowoverall value for money
close your eyes and go for it
well we all know about the pros and cons
the experience with the device is awsum
the only issue is heating
whenever it gets heated you can drop it in water since it is water resistant it will not run down and get cool quickly
jokes apart
good smart phone
but moto should give a competition to one plus
the product was well packed delivery the next day of the order
loudspeaker is good
clear loud
battery is amazing only if u r using one sim
can last for 2 days at normal usage
mite differ for others
incall hearing is good too
feels good in the hand
nice grip
with water resistance
camera quality is not that great tho its 13mp
my nexus 5 does the better job der
over all the phone is great for day to day usage
looks great feels great
thank u
so i bought this mobile with in a day delivery and flipkart did a great job at that
the mobile itself is quite power packed with following prosfast boottwist wrist shake functionsfast processing no lagging with heavy use for a 24 hrs userubber back case awesome gripcurvy designguaranteed to get marshmallow pretty soon
conscamera not better
but overall am pretty satisfied with my purchase at this price
i received this before 2 days
here is my experiences with this product moto g turbo editionbuild quality is very niceno extra preloaded apps
camera is nice
if you want high quality result then buy professional camera
battery works fine if you are not a gamerturbo charger can charge this moto in approx 15 to 2 hoursnot lagging while playing games
consit should come with data cablehead phones is not the best it is not bad toodisplay is not bright enoughwhite
but quality is fineyou have to download new launcher app to remove google search box from home screen
bottom lineevery mobile has one or more advantages and disadvantagesbut if are quality lover
go for it
it has display issuesmotorola is using cheap displaymobile is overheating when charging 42 to 48 degreesi am getting screen lights on the power and volume button
the mobile looks great but didnt feel its user friendlyi have used nokia samsung sony thy r good in thr own way

moto g turbo update required battery draining fast for normal use
this price bying super foneflipkar packing is goodno hang specifications super dis advantages no usb cable in boxearfone old modelcharging time heating problembattery
drain fastheating above 45 degree celcius
after using iphone from last 2 years
i wanted to get a taste of andriod
so i was comparing vivo v1 and motogot my moto today
its impressive at 1st looksturdystrongquickgood touch things i dnt liked ishd screen is not that impressive
micromax canvas 5 has a brilliant screen at 12kcamera bad
remember i was using an iphone 4s i will use this for a week and update you with my review
till that timekeep rocking
this one is value for money
the first look of phone will be breathtaking
very good build quality
great sound awesome displayam happy that i purchased it
as we snapdragon 615 octa core processor has heating issues so you can decide now
turbo charging battery but it drains at same speed
it is similar with other moto g phones so you will have compromise with the look and finishing
best phone under 15000sometimes
specs in real are more important than paperno
need for second opinion just go for it
i bought this mobile during december 2016 good mobile charging quickly very useful during travel solid body good response in multitasking sound clarity during call etc constrainthead phone could be better
only drawback isit gets heated alot on charging and also with prolonged use
everything else looks good within this price range
phone is good using from 19 jan 2016
little bit heating issue some time not as much hot as i read in previous reviewsall fetures are upto mark except 2 of them
1st battry drain fast on using internet by sim not drain fast over wifi
2nd camera is ok ok good in day light
got his phone around 4 days back
updated with marshmallow 603 mb file
exchanged this during republic day sale with my moto g2 for 4k
main thing that i would like to mention is about heating issue that many are worried about
in fact i too went thru multiple reviews on youtube and else where before buying this phone
at one time i even thought of replacing my moto g2 with moto g3 instead of g turbo
no heating issue at allon day 1 jan 23 when i switched on the mobile i did find that the phone got warm all of a sudden
but post that i have been using wifi 3g 4g social media etc
there is no heating issue at all
this is honest review
most surprising i do not find heating issue even while using turbo charger
not sure if the later shipped handsets are with some updates
moto turbo chargerkiller awesome
charges from 12 to 45 in just around 20 min
and full charge in an hour i mean around 95
cameravery good in day light
in low light it is okay no complain as well
one issue i found with marshmallow updateremaining battery display is weird
some time it shows 15 hours left for 75 charge sometime 12 left for 43 charge
i no longer see it now
battery backupi am a normal user and do not play games as such
for me it easily lasts throughout the day with normal to heavy net surfing 3g4g wifi facebook etc best thing i observe is when the mobile is on stand by modenot in use battery backup is like awesome
not even 1 drops for as long as 30 min
performancethis is one key thing i noticed as i was earlier using moto g2
superb performance
you can notice how fast apps open on the fly
you can clearly distinguish
great
so overall i would say this is a best buy at this price or in case you want to exchange though the same is not available right now as i write
solid look as well
after using moto mobiles with stock android experience i find difficult to move to nonmoto mobilesbelieve me no heating issues at all
giving 4 star rating
wish i could give 4 and half
first and foremost would like to clear the biggest doubt here
there is no excess heating on this fone like mentioned in many reviews due to its octacore processor or for whatever reason
you could feel a bit of heat while charging since the fone is a completely sealed piece for water proofing it else there is no noticeable heat while browsing for long hrs or so
secondly would like to congratulate motorola for a truly exceptional product release at this price particularly deserves praise for incorporating the most needed feature for any fones these days turbo charger to the moto g 3rd gen model
proshats off for the addition of turbo charger which in fact is included in the package unlike for other moto fones where it needs to purchased separately for a price of 25k apprx
it charges the fone from 20100 in roughly about an hr
solid build quality of the back cover that provides a premium feel n touch besides an excellent grip
the sound quality is top notch super clean n loud
it would have been perfect if it were stereo but you could still let go of it
picture quality graphics and ui is quintessential moto qualityseamless peppy and upmarket
i must mention its one of the few fones that comes with an option to upgrade to marsh mellow in as early as jan thats huge
processor is lighting fast due to the addition of octacore processor and a decent 2 gb of memorycomes
with a slot to upgrade for more space which is great cos nexus fones dont have one
camera is quite decent probably the best at this price cons earphones are pretty basic cant expect much for this price anyways
usb cable not included providing one would just make life easier for the customer if he doesnt have one not sure why they havent included a cheap accessory such as this one when they can provide an expensive charger
the phone definitely feels on the heavier side especially when held for long hrs 150gms
overall if youre looking a a big brandsuperior sound quality solid built a modern ui the fastest charger ever all of which u find in nexus fones but cant afford it this is the one for youdont break your head too much for this price just go for it
i received the product 2 days after the order was placed i am very happy with the fast delivery of product
the device got updated to marshmallow as soon as i powerd on the device thanks to 4g speedthe phone is very good dosent hang at all no lags or whatsoever great display waterproof amazing processor awesome gaming performance even though snapdragon 615 is underclocked at 15ghz still it is same processor that is being used in moto x play have tried lara croft relic run mortal kombat x gta sa gta 3 all nin high graphics and mostly full settings but yes there resides a but battery hardly lasts half a day on normal usage lowest brightness 6090 min gaming hardly 30 min callgps on 4g data turned on only when needed for browsing or whatsapp youll need to carry a power bank wherever you go or else battery would be depleted they say battery can survive a day of mix usage id like to say i cant even survive half day of mixed or even normal usage looks like motorola has provided turbo charging feature as an atonement to poor no very poor battery life
turbo charger performance has been similar to moto 3g charger performance
battery has been draining fast
when used 4g sim in one slot signal stopped for every 34 hrs again i have to switch off phone and restart againthis
makes receiving of emergency calls problem
in another slot data only coming but unable to call
this makes the product useless
head phones are not at all good comapred to lg h442
charger lacks usb cable which should be basic thing for rs15000 worth mobilethis
makes difficult to connect to pc to store data to pc
this phone is worst than the before models like moto3getc
but costs more than before generations
phone is getting more heated when charged and watching youtube
charging of this phone is taking time similar to moto3g and earlier generations
there is no name significance of turbo apparant when using
looks sar also high when kept at ear during talking
please do not purchase
life is a gamble
some choices r rt some wrong
reason i gave 1 star is cuz yesterday 20116
the phone was priced at 11kthe phone was launched on 1012
15 145k
the phone was delivered to me on the 211215 145k
so just after a month of its launch the phone has depreciated by 3k
and for good reason motorola and or flipkart are selling an inferior product
they strategically overvalued it so brand crazy consumers would rush
now substantially devalued it so that its truly an overvalued below budget phone
my previous phone was a nokia lumia 925 which cost me 26k a few months after it was launched
so compared to my previous phone this phone lagsthe octa core and 2 gb ram is nt 4x n 2x the specs of my previous phonenever imagined the usable memory will only be 11gb of 16gb
the phone display quality is bullshittingly coarsethe display glass got scratched within 3 days of extremely careful use
the camera suckseither there is a shutter lag or the image stability is crap
to be honest i have not used yet used the secondary camera as im not a selfie fan
the battery on full charge maybe lasts me 24 hours on standby
3 to 4 hours surfing the internet n0 multitaskingsimilarly 3 to 4 hours using only gps and zero multitaskingnever played games
the touch response is too sensitive cant b adjusted
this phone is ip 67 meaning its dust and waterproof
but dust seems to get impregnated behind the back cover as well as the two front slits
shattered my faith is in it being waterproof
mind you i bought this phone after extensively reading about the specs and related news regarding the moto g turbo edition
verdictoverall dnt recommend
overvalued below budget phone 11k
i bought mine at 145k
amazingly great and dependable in every aspect
camera quality very goodsoftware performance very smoothhardware rating sturdybuilt in quality class ano over heating or battery drainage problemsturbo charging great featureall in all in my opinion the best product in this rangevery trust worthy
4 star for the phone but just 1 star for flipkart bcs no delivery at my place
had to arrange for delivery at my frnds location in chandigardh there also flipart took 3 days to deliver although its just 6 hours away frm delhi where single day delivery is available
coming to the phone build quality 1010 solid feels really good
looks decent
water n dust proof
size thickness 910 i like smaller 45 screen size
5 inch screen size is some what big for me but its ok not an issue getting used to it
thickness of the phone is perfect
i dont understand why companies making super thin and 6 inch size phones display quality 1010 specs may tell u that its not hd but i dont need a better display than this call quality 1010 just awesome performance mutitasking 1010 i dont play heavy games
no heating issue
only a very mild heating while charging
sound quality 910 user interface 710 very fast n no bloatware but it lacks customization n features
i think asus zen ui is lot better
camera 810 rear camera 810 front camera 910 camera app 510 low light performance 710 battery 1010 awesome long lasting n turbo charging
gives me 24 hours usage value for money 0810 over all 0910
whats the price
rs 12499 is the price i got it foryes in this price tag there are many phones but with dual sim 4g and sd card and turbo charging
i am sure you will not find a phone with these specs atleast when i bought i dint find p well heating
i use the phone for whatsapp social networking like fb and listening to music and browsing
for games you need to spend a lot more than this i am a gamer i have other consoles for gamesd
so yes no heating if you use this phone like i use it
batter back up is good no regrets buying this phone at this price
thank you flipkart for fast delivery only one drawback no usb may be because of turbo charger and btw earphones are awesomeits comfortable
if you are looking for a light good looking phone and phone for normal usage go for it
got the phone delivered in one day ofcrs opted for 1 day delivery pthe phone got good looks
solid sturdy and feels comfortable in the hand
my findingspros water proof dust proofqsd 615 octacore with adreno 405 same as that of moto x play you can play all the games better than moto x play but loading will be slowgood build qualitysuperb performancesufficient internal storage1097gb and ram2gbgood audio quality speaker ear pieceturbo chargercharging 50 in 3035min 80 in 1hour 100 in 1 hour 30 minstock android no bloatwareotggood display with enough brightness
consmajor con is heating
it reaches above 40c just like that
even with a normal usageturn
on wifi it will heat up
even under charging also
the back and the screen will get warm
ofcrs its not that much heat but you wont feel comfortable
when it gets warm the phone will lag a bitno usb cablebasic headphones which everyone hatesspeakers should have been better just like the moto g2720p tft display
you can find small lines on the display if you see clearly
no one will notice that so its not that bad
should have been an ips displaycamera is not that great
i dont see the clarity even though its 13mp
front cam is averagebattery drains fast
its better than moto g3
except the heating everything is fine
but if you already have moto g3 then no need to buy this one
wait for january 2016 you can get the next gen processor phones
and alternative phones for this which i feel will be samsung galaxy j7 one plus x lenovo vibe p1 lenovo vibe s1yeah little bit higher price though
hope my review gives you a better idea about the device
decide yourself
im pretty much satisfied with the phone after 2 weeks of usagethe looks as well as the performance are awesome
it easily deals with high end games like asphalt 8
the camera is great in daylight but its so poor in artificial light
we can clearly see those grains on the screen when used in artificial light
saw a lot of reviews that the phone heats while charging and other usage
but till now i didnt find any slight change in temp during charging and other usage
either those guys dont know the difference between warming and heating or they might have got a defective product
but still i accept that it gets a little bit heated when heavy games are played and which phone doesnt heat when heavy games are played
the battery backup is okay but should have been better
using an upgraded processor than that of g3 and the same 2470 mah battery doesnt sound good
should have been somewhere around 27002800 mah
but to an extent turbo charging provides a solution
charges 080 in around one hour
the headphones provided really sucks
music lovers should definitely buy another one
for others its okay
flipkart is great in terms of delivery time
saw a lot of negative reviews in the case of returns replacement services another problem is the after sale service of motorola
i had a poor experience with my moto e motorola really needs to improve a lot more in this area hope my turbo wont get into any damage
overall a nice productwould give 4 stars one star cut for the poor headphones and the average battery backup
everything is alright with this phone from calling to battery backup to performancebut i purchased it on 5 january and today heard that prices have been slashed by 2krequesting flipkart to pass on this discount if im eligible for this discount
it has everything you need not want
it is the premium phone for a budget user who needs all the basics at very good quality and something more
great performance playing asphalt 8 airborne without any glitchesgreat displaygood cameracall quality is fine no issues so far4g reception is great note that this can be turned on only on any one of the simsbattery is good lasts 2 days with normal use calls some social media some games turbo charging is useful
this phone does have the ecompass sensors the
phone does not include the basic sensors such as gyroscope hall effect sensor magnetometer
lack of this sensors affect the end user experience
the perfect phone that there iswaterproofoctacore2 gigs of ramgorilla glassdecent cameraboth front and back and impressive sound quality and most importantly turbo chargingbelieve me motorola gave its best to create this midrange beastbeing using it as my personal device for over a weektill now my reaction hats off to the motorolalenovo mobility
i have been using moto g turbo from last 20 days and purchased from flipkart
delivery was good
the phone gives all the features that you want front camera clarity is excellent while rear camera is excellent from short distance but not from long distance
but it is not an issue when everything is good
you can charge it within 30 to 40 minutes charging is also fast
its earphone is not good but it is not a con
i really recommend moto g turbo to my friends
somebody tells its cost is more
we are indians always want more from less
i am using this phone from past 15 weeks and here are few pros and cons prosgreat design and lookgood touch sensitivitygood performance 2gb ram coming handy herespeedy battery recharge thanks to turbo chargerboth camera quality is good google camera app quality look better than moto buildin camera appvoice communication is clearwifi and cellular data works just fine
consbattery discharges very fast as it charges need to recharge 2times a daydevice gets heated up soon if you browsing 30 minsobserved frequent signal drop in dual sim mode i have 2 vodafone sims when one shows full signal other dropsobserved device hang few times when running online shopping apps in the boxmobile headset not good for music manual wall chargerno usb data cable hope this helps
i am writing this based on my hands on experience on this beautiful gadget
lot has been written about pros and cons of this handset
rather than repeating them again i would just list down issues which many over here complain and my experience about same
heating heating of phones is something everyone complains which in fact is warming not heatingso called heating usually happens while using phone when it is still plugged in for chargingusing demanding apps and graphic intensive games beyond the limits of processor to handle agreed there are few units which may have genuine problems but that doesnt mean all handsets will have same problem
i have used phones like moto g moto e xiaomi redmi 1s but never had any such so called heating problem
i owned moto x as my business phone and currently i m using blackberry q5 for sameeven
these sometimes warm a bit if i use it while plugged in for chargeg turbo has no such problems
battery it goes 12 hrs on an avg with full on wifi connectivity and calls
it would dip down if you use it for movies games etcthat is not a big prob
camera both cameras are good enough
if someone is looking for professional results in terms of pics then one should opt for actual cameras
phone cameras are not meant for that
performance good enough when compared to specs
no lags at all
games games work fine
but of course if you are looking for playing high end graphics intensive games then it would be better to buy some game console
business users it works smoothly when it comes to emails docs and scheduling
absolutely no lag
no product is perfect but we as a user should know how to use it perfectly
in all its a decent multitask gadget when it comes to hardware and nearly stock android software and we as user should know how to use its potential to max
i would recommend it by all means
full 5 stars to flipkart for delivery of product
good looking smart phone
specs are definitely high on score
phone heats on charging and usage
apps like tmemo is missing unlike samsungmigrate is a good feature for transferring your databegan using on a holiday when there would be less calling but was surprised to see battery drain pretty fasthope there are pleasant surprises ahead and not disappointing shocks
a good transition from samsung which has become monotonous to use
flawless awsmbest n fastest phone i ever hadthnk you moto n flipcart tooinitial impression look like copy cat of moto g 3rd genbut upgraded with processor and included turbo charging and safety of the device prosnice build qualityaudio quality of the ear piece is looks goodaudio quality of the speaker is looks goodturbo charging charging the device very quicklyturbo

previously i was using motog2
features well match with the expectationsbattery is too good comparatively with motog2

cons not found yet
extremely good mobile and all the features has been configured well
camera high clarity battery amazing stuff to stay longer

happy to moto g turbo edition
its an awesome phone from motorola
but there are some pros and cons
prosbuild quality look feel is awesomestock android 511
expected to get android m soonperformance is good enough as it is powered by octacore processorsound quality is pretty good although it has only one speaker unlike moto x style which has dual front speakerturbo charging is superb it took only 1hr 15min to charge from 11 to 100
consmajor con is heating
the phone heats up when playing games like asphalt nitro
also i observed major heating while recording video with default camera app for 13 minutes the phone get heated upto 472 degree cprimary camera is unable to produce good enough picture as expected from 13mpthe phone hangs when it is hot ie for my case after 13 minutes of video recording the phone was not responding for about 12 minutes
overall the phone can be great if the heating and hanging issue is fixed via update
please be aware that you are not going to get an usb with the mobile only turbo charger you will get and if you need to charge other than that you need to buy external usb
the images are not truthful they show charger containing usb but it is not not we will getting only one end connector for this
phone is too good motorola is one of my fav
turbo charging is doing fine no heating issue
the only thing that made me sad is cheap quality earphone other wise phone is awesome1
star for bad quality earphones
review after a weekreally best product by moto heating problem was for 12 days but after dat it heats normally bateery issue is too same first 12 days it was drained fastly but after it giving me good performence turbo charging is soo good it chages 0 to 100 in aprox
90 to 105 minuts my suggestion is always charge it 100 so it will give you better performence overall a decent phoneand one more its camera just amazing still u want better 1 den buy moto x play or a dslr d
super mob cool to useit will charge within 2 hrs when ur battery is fully drained
nexus 6p is perfect power packed phone except screen mirroring is possible through chromecast only which i got free with this phone casting directly on wifi tv not happening till now and still trying to figure out without chromecast
in short hardcore phone if you keep chromecast with the phone
after a fortnight of usage
outstanding phone
superfast processer
abundant ram
vivid screen
longlasting battery
brilliant os
a head turner by looks
will buy it again if i have to
awesome designawesome displayawesome finger print sensorawesome sound from the speakers in the phone
and best of all awesome camera only the battery life not better
i got this device yesterday and it is awesomeflipkart packed really good chromecast back cover and device box first look super clear large display with good view anglesgood build loved my grey 32 gb modelcamera is pretty awesomelow light pics are really good fast
nexus imprintclean software
phone is great kind of huge
others have covered it well
the case is pretty much a waste
i have to order a new one
screen is gorgeous
battery life is also amazing
overall very happy with the phone
phone was delayed and i got a refund of 1k for the delao
however flipkart really nailed the delivery
delivered the night before diwali at 930 pm
awesome diwali gift from flipkart
i switched from the nexus 5 to the 6p
so the usp was always going to be about the hardware specs and the new premium features as i have the latest software running on the nexus 5 as well and so far am very happy
phone feels solid and premium in all respects
it is a large phone and you need to be sure you are comfortable with that
am still getting used to the size
unlocking using nexus imprint is a breeze
screen and sound quality are awesome
the freebies chromecast back cover and earbuds shipped with the phone
am awaiting the yatra vouchers and the airtel double data offer details
flipkart exceeded my expectation as i thought the shipping date would move out given the global demand
definitely recommend this to those looking for a 55 device
one of the best android phones available in the market now
blazing fast fingerprint reader and overall experience is amazing
camera performs in par with an iphone 6s
worth every penny
to make it shortfirst when i ordered the phone it had a yellow tint on screenthe whites on the display appeared yellowish when u changed the angle of the phonen yes i tried turning off the adaptive display feature from the settings but it didnt change anythingthen i requested a replacement hoping that it was a defect only in my piecegot the replaced product in 4 daysbut the new piece was even worse and in addition to the yellow tint problem it even had scratches on the sides at 3 placesnow i have finally asked for refund and hope i get it soon conclusion most of the phones have the yellow tint problem and since it happened twice its definitely a manufacturing defectplz avoid it buying from flipkart
the phone is smooth as hell camera is insanely very good fingerprint scanner is spot on accurate music i didnt check yet though m a audiophile ill do it later
the biggest issue m facing is the display its kinda yellowish its not a proper display i think its a defected pieceflipkart how to replace my device
i need a fix for it
i was using htc m9 as my daily driver and switched to nexus 6p for a better camera fast charging and the pure google experience
the device i received had a massive yellow tint to it
i right away understood that it was a faulty display and might be a oneoff incident
after waiting for almost 3 weeks for the release i got a device that was faulty
flipkart could not replace it as it was out of stock and they refunded the amount
i feel let down by flipkart because of their supply chain issues and delay in delivery of the product
also i think huawei could also have improved on their quality checks
overall a really poor customer experience
ps
the device is huge
hi everyone nexus 6p is great awesome as suggested in all the reviews written and you have received but it has inherent echo issue while talking to someone on speaker phone
your own voice gets echoed multiple times on speaker which very annoying for both you and person you are calling
i have tried everything from resetting phone to check every settings in phone
but in vain so please hold off buying this phone until this issue is solved
please do not waste your money on nexus 6p it has a lag and stutter issue some apps especially youtube unfortunately has stopped some apps opening get long time play store everytime said times outbenchmark score showed poorgeekbench 3 4951885antutu 38994
amazing performance
loved every aspect of nexus 6p from camera to performance
however there are three things which i have noticed in this device
ambient display doesnt work properly
adaptive brightness is slow
so if you take this device to direct sunlight it will brighten up the screen with noticeable lagand the last is most weird as i dont know if other also noticed it
if you shoot video with your earphone plugged in the device you will hear some weird clutter like sound while playing the same video
i dont know if its a manufacturing defect or whatever but i have noticed that every time
apart from above three points buy this phone for performance camera fingerprint scanner almost everything
i have used many high end android devices like xperia z1 xperia x10 samsung s3 moto razr
but nexus 6p is the only android device which gives justice to all the comparison parameters on which a smart phone is evaluated
below would be my ratings on a scale of 15 1 being lowest and 5 being highest
screen size 5resolution 45product feel 5camera 475phone usage speed or processor 45multitasking 475battery 475 best till date

received it yesterday
prospremium lookgood sound quality from speakers as well as supplied headphonesbest android experience my last phone note 2 sucks as no update and it was stuck in 442 got freeback covergoogle chrome cast deviceworth
rs 2500
as soon as i connected to internet it showed me 601 81mb update available which in samsung will come after ages
no more wait for real time updates really excited to use google nexus 6p
i got this phone a month back bought it under exchange offer got a hell of a deal from flipkart exchanged my 1 year old iphone 5s for 20k and got this for 20000 only
i have used different android phones in past but i get bore with them very easily but this is different its nexus
i will not do any pros and cons type of review and you guys already know the details of it
battery backup is good
my usage is heavy and this phone last easily one day for me
camera is amazing
friends in my group now dont pull there phones out for any picture they ask for my phone hahaha
value for money but 40k for 32 gb with no expendable memory
i bought this phone only get my slow iphone 5s
initially i thought i will regret switching from ios to android
launchers are there on android which make you feel at home if you are apple fan boy
after looking at my phone few of colleague bought this phone and they all are happy
the awesomeness of this phone is too high
i have been using this phone for over 2 months now
i had prebooked it in oct end and received it on nov 14
i play games surf the net office emails basic fb insta use various heavy apps and trust me
there is no lagging
in android my last phone was samsung note 2 a beautiful phone but had its issues
and i shifted to nexus 6p from iphone 5s which was butter smooth
but nexus is just smoother than the smoothestthe clarity of the images and color highlights of the images captured is beautiful
being a selfie fan i can assure you that the front camera is awesome
for me it was absolutely worth to spend my money on this phone
cheers
this phone is the best
i switched from my 3 months old one plus 2 to nexus 6p
although none of the phonw will have any lag but when you start using nexus you will realise the overall smoothness in the android osi switched from one plus 2 because i felt the os was not perfect
phone had some minor issues and those issues were still present after the updatetheir have been issues regarding muffled voice call quality of this phone
their is no such issue and after a long time i have a phone on which i can use loudspeaker during calls without other party noticing it
cons i feel the screen is a bit on yellowish side
when i compare it will other phones i really feel the yellow tint
thanks
hello i have brought this phone on 23rd december simply awesome phone price is little bit costly but awesome camera in day time awesome front facing camera is great
battery backup is little bit low but get charged quickly with its own charger
truely octacore processor while playing any game it doesnt get hanged no
heating problem

phone have battery issue speaker also not working properly and main thing this the phone with dual sim which never detect the networkand still after 10th day flipkart customer care did not support mestill it have 30 day replacement guarantee
hi guys i have bought this device one month back even i have purchased this device by seeing all the reviewsbut now im very happy with the device performance finally only one word to say worth a single penny and guys go for it
recently i bought this handset from univercell based on the review read from internethere
are my experience with this handsetpros good build qualityfast responsivegood output speakgood battery backupgood camera clarity conswithout cover case handset slips as body finish is smoothvery bad headset output as output does not differentiate between treble and bass
10 days of usage and a lot of experiment and a genuine feedback
here it goes good looks but cheap built and feel
camera is average
have certain focus issues but ok
call quality not impressive
moto g2 was better i feel when it comes to mic sensitivity
apps work smooth
multitasking with a 2 sec lag but its expected out of a 1gb ram the most appreciated part is battery life
15 days average user and heavy data user it lasts just over a day
that really surprised me
worst ui when it comes to htc blinkfeed
no htc sense is a drawback
htc has lost its differentiating factor
very bad decision
hardware compromise is understood but os very stock androidvery important it comes with kitkat 442 and no update to 444
headphones provided with the phone i bet you cant even sell it to a friend for 50 bucks good signal and wifidisplay is good and colours very crisp and text is readable at all lightsaverage speaker and a very bad stock music player
better get some paid music player if u are music loverbottomline go for it if u are ok with all this else get moto g2
both have its own pros and cons
the ultimate decision lies with you
go with your heart
thank you guys

i bought this phone and i was happy that i got it in 3 days
hats off to flipkart
then comes the product
at its worstthe speaker doesnt workthe battery backup was only for 45 mins and i had to charge it 7 times on the first day i bought iti charged t for 8 hours in the beginning and then started using itwhen
i came back from shopping in 2 hours the phone was dead and i had to return the product
thanks for the immediate refund flipkart
appreciate it
ive been using this phone since 15 days
look wise its bestboth front 5mp and main8mp cameras give a good picruns really smooth with 17ghz and octa core processorno cons found and i am sure i wont thank you flipkart for helping me choose the right productoverall the best product at 12k
in this set htc 620g have many problems that i am mentioning below

i am facing hell out of problems with this mobile i bought this phone for around 12k
for the first two months it worked properly but then it started troubling
below listed are the problems i am facing hope it will be helpfull
sometimes it doesnt allow us to lift the cal screen wont show upi had set a song as ring tone it plays whole song whenever i get a calsuddenly gets switch offunable to transfer the files from laptopdesktop to this phone
an awesome mid range kitkat device for those who r not music lovers because it having poor sound quality otherwise its a perfect android phonego for it if u r not music lover
dont go on the namethe battery drains out so fast like just now it was 82 and after that it become 78 wish i could have change it with other mobilesother features are however ok
the only good thing i could find is its battery
it took 4 days to discharge its battery completely
i used only one sim and average wifi browsing 3hrs a day and average music play 30minutes a day cons music sound speaker volume is very feebleneither stereo speakers nor boom speakerspathetic sound quality headset comes in sale package is the worst in the world
display touchblack is not that black and white is not that whitepoor touch responseno htc sense ui it comes with stock os
htc cheated customers by making ads that it had sense uidisplay is not 5 may be 48 because os controls like home back recent app button take space
camerarearcamera app doesnt sense correct iso exposure brightnessthey are claiming that it has camera tool
i couldnt find any
its just a basic camera appvideo recording is also poor when camera is movingtheres no image stabilizer camera position is very bad
it captures our fingers also while taking a photograph use of flash is better in using it as a torch camera frontyou can take selfies but you cannot take groufiespros music soundgraphic equalizer is very goodwhile using a good headset it reproduce high quality sound
display touchviewing angle is surprisingly greatcolours are naturaltouch is ok while gaminggraphics is upto standard camera rearwhile manual setting camera is ok
camera frontfront camera is surprisingly great and it takes crystal clear selfies
bought this phone a week ago on performance basis this phone cant match with moto g 2nd gencamera quality is lowerlag in playing heavy graphics gameheating
camera quality averagespeaker below averagebattery backup goodgaming goodmultitasking goodmemory 43 gb usable only out of 8 gb
hi love htc phones
used htc desire hd a9191 for almost three years with no issues
i bought this phone week ago battery backup is not good for such big screen
big big disappointment is that it does not have any notification led light
some times call logs are messy it overwritten text hard to read and select this is really big trouble for me
contact search ui is also very poor
really dont recommend this phone looks wise its good phone to have
display really good high pixel density display that never puts you off as long as you keep it on autobrightness and let it do its magic in different ambient settings
sun legibility is top notch too
processing although it is a really short time to say about its long term prowess but the processor and ram look capable of pulling just about any stunt
i have so installed a total of 200 apps on my phone with blinkfeed set up and notifications on for instagram twitter whatsapp hike and emails but the phone never slows down for a mili second
previously used nexus 5 moto e and moto g battery life since i am mostly out and lazy enough to not charge my devices every moment i was keen on getting a device with a lasting battery but this is a massive powerhouse when it comes to battery
i used it all day with sync on and 3g data with half an hour calling and no games and the battery is still at 70 at the end of the evening
very impressed
keyboard even though i am not a fan of inbuilt keyboards i found the htc sense keyboard pretty usable but switched to my trusted swiftkey on the second day to type while i swipe my fingers when walking around
works like a charm
camera the camera quality is several points higher compared to the moto g2 and the front camera is perfect for selfies even though i hate them
body the make of the phone is quite pleasing but the back is glossy
fixed it with a matte finish back panel
notification led missing from the phone but you are unlikely to miss it that much especially with the dot matrix cover
google it overall the phone is a definite value for money device and comes with that extra appeal thats missing in bland moto devices and a pleasing htc ui which got updated the first thing when i booted device
verdict specs on the paper fall like marbles in comparison to the overall performance of this device
extremely happy
very good mobile within budgetgood camerasgood battery backupuser friendlyi will suggest to my friends for purchase of this mobile
this one is the best in midrange mobiles from htcit works smooth no lag till now cool lookgood processorif you are looking for brand with android then you have no option other than htc
completely worth for every single penny best htc handset at this price
loving itive been using this phone for the past one week and trust me this is one of the best highrange android htc variants
im an android junior developer and ive been testing the performance of this phone at every possible rate
please review after using this product and not by seeing the specs
this phone has the following pros and cons pros sharp super lcd displaybeautiful design and very slim obviously fits your pocketcamera
ah yeah how did i forget that
it has a hot back camera of 8mp which completely suits for the resolution of the phone screen
meritshtc desire look and feel is goodcamera clarity is goodphone doesnt hang and no slowness issue
demeritsas per the add given in flipcart the os version was kitkat 444 but when i received the product it is 442my headset is not working after 20 days of useprice is bit high compared to other brand products
i have last week purchased lava iris x8 and i am using lava company flipcover but this phone is hanging issue to much while receiving calls even not able to attend call
pleas do the needful
i have been using this product for 10 days now i love flipkarts one day service in delhi
i was looking for a phone under 10k for last 1 month and have been trying to buy yu every week but was not able to buy one
seems like it was my good luck when i came across lava iris x8 and ordered from flipkart
why you should buygreat multitasking device i have to attend approx 200 mails 500 whatsapp messages 100 phone calls a day plus i use google maps before i start driving to any place to check traffic condition i am logged in on all social networking apps and the last one is i am also logged in to all shopping apps for special deals
thanks to octa core processor 2gb ram iris x8 handles all of them really well
extra storage my old memory card was just about to get full and i was to upgrade to a new 32 gb mmc for all my pictures and videos but now i dont need a new mmc
i have inserted my old 16gb mmc and using phones 12gb memory available for users as my primary memory
brilliant display display quality and screen experience is really great
touch screen is real soft in finish hd ips screen gives brilliant color quality
battery backup i use to charge my old phone atleast twice during the day and at times trhice too but now it seems like i have so much of freedom
battery easily lasts full day and my phone still has power when i reach home
really happy with battery backup
there is so much more in this phone you will love it once you experience the same
now the consdidnt find much cons in this phone its just that it feels a bit thick and heavy but i am ok with it as i need to compromise somewhere for a bigger battery
i would say not to buy this phone due to below reasons build quality is worst backpanel if very thin and it will break while openingcamera is utter waste although they say primary is 8 mpits more weight compared to other phonesspeaker is worst very poor quality couldnt hear outside
properformance is really good
touch is nice consbattery cannot be removedi am saying this as a problem because for me it happened that i tried to install an android update and the phone came to bootloader screen
the update was not compatible so it didnt install and then phone was stuck on that screen
there was no way to come out
power button was also not working
in this case if battery can be removed it would have been easier
its very good mobile
prosno battery heating problemgood battery back as compare to asus zenofone 5gesture sensor2gb ram16 gb rom consnot attractive like asus zenofone modelsback cover is very delicate it may have chances to break down during removingfront camera quality is low though it is 3 mpno multiple option available like asus zenofone 5 so we cannot edit the photo as we requirecharging takes too much time
overall i will give 355 for this model
cons battery back up is really bad drains real fastcamera is really really really bad for a10mp in both natural light and artificial light
in ear phones cheap and really bad soundcharger only 1 amp takes ages for the handset to charge and really cheap quality data cablespeaker is really low even at high volume
network issues keeps loosing the 3g network indoors and outdoors as well
pros for nowi really like the screen really bright indoors and out doors as welluser interface is smooth and lagless
for the people of fk selling this phone please inform the people at lava to sort out these issues with this handset recall all handsets sold and replace develop otas for issues mentioned in the cons sections
this leaves a bad taste in ones mouth for an indian company and for the consumers who are eager to use an indian phone made by an indian company5 stars for the display and lag free ui but 5 stars for the other glitches in the handset
powerful octacore processor can handle most games
played ashphalt nfs and many more without laggingyet few phones are coming with 17ghz against 14ghz with iris8
but with the price point of view i would give 910 display is nice and crisp
to get the better feel you need to take out the actual plastic guard which comes with the phone
the asahi glass is quite scratch resistant yet again the resolution could be better but overall quite happy with the quality since the view angle is quite impressive
910 8mp main camera and 3mp selfie cameras are at the mark
13 mp cameras are quite been standardized
lava are you listening
810 gesture technology is at its best
quite impressive
after using multi brand phones without gesture technology this is one is new and unique
once you get a hang of it its easy and fun 1010 build quality and style is neat
apple might curse since iris 8 looks a iphone
was bugged of glossy finish with my previous phone
the neat matt finish gives a classy look
finishing is neat and clean 910 runs on android kitkat v44 os and lava has promised upgrade to v5 lollipop
waiting for it
sound is clear no issues with calls and network
accessories are as usual like any other phone
in short a nice value for money budget phone under 9k
nice to see indian brand lava providing such great product
lets seeeee delivery1010 design 1010 touch 9510 display9510

my review after using this phone 1 day problem little heat in short i am statisfy with the product
i love taking pics of my friends my family nature food so the camera has to be good in any phone i buy
for long time i wanted a cool camera smartphone and iris x8 was fitting in my budget so i ordered it
the 8 mp camera comes with dual led flash and should give really good pics
the best part is i can take full hd recording as well
nice memory and battery means i can take loads of pics and store them without any performance problems
overall great specs from lava hope it lives up to my expectations too
i bought this phone about two weeks back
find it nice for my usage as i dont play games
my usage is office mail access outlook chats private emails private entertainment etc works well
screen is good though you may find some finger prints it wont affect you much as its bright enough
under sun light you might want to increase brightness
look and feel is similar to iphone speaker is nice
camera is nice too
i took some photos indoor with bright open window in background but camera did its job
i am happy with camera and all other featurs except the earphones whiche are junk
you may buy something nice of your choice since i like to listen nice music in my spare time
overall good phone
i wanted to buy yureka i give up since it disappears in 1 second
may be my pc or net is very slow
but i am not at all sorry i find iris x8 much better choice compared to some of the top brands
internet wifi work as required
those users who use phone similar choice can go for this
my earlier choices were all sony ericsson but i find this one no where lesser than sony except music quality which is good but not at par with sony
i accidentally falled it down approx 3 ft height but still works well
infact those who handle this phone i can clearly see that they will envy you
does not heat up at all
good luck guys
dear friends this is one the best phone under 10 k
the display quality battery performace and phone built are excellent
2gb ram octa core processor 16 gb internal storage full hd features makes phone more powerful
guys please go ahead and buy this one you will really feel happy about this phone
just one thing to add the sound quality is good for average music lovers but i hope lava can improve this in their next iris release
thanks to lava for bringing such descent class phone in indian market and thanks to flipkart for their excellent service
i m using lava product lava is the greet performance new kitkat version battery backup is very long time and support to all full hd videos also to be copy apple 6so that is cameratouching displayweightand looking is very nice and standard price
pros looks like premium phone display is pretty goodsmart gestures2gb ram cons camera is of poor quality
infact my moto g 5p can take better pictures than thisback panel has so many closing locks
high chances the locks can be broken
when ever i update the software it asks to insert sd card
god knows why when its a 16 gb phone
i have replaced the handset but the same problem is new one toono led notification in one word buy for awesome display and look but dont expect too much in performance
well was little hesitant to choose lava but anyway tried it would be a good gamble unfortunately it is not
call clarity 25camera 25
8 mp camera
bull shit
my old lumia 520 with 5 mp could do much better without flashinterface 35 its fast and doesnt lag much
but just stock android experience
basic un updated version of kitkat
442keypad
this was a serious let down because texting is such a pain in a
its not precise and no scramble keyboard
you have to type out every single word trust me i dont even like using whatsapp after using this phone
the only positives are you get 12 gb of phone memory and thats it
god only knows what problem it ll bring forth
and how to find service centers for this
final verdict doenst deserve 9 grand
just got the external looks good inside its crap
invest your money in good devices
received mobile after 3day
used 5 hrs and i write my reviews i am used mi redmi 1st 1gb redmi note 2gb and 4g 2gb 1st coming under 6k and another 2 pone 9 k 10k mi phone heavy weight not looking dashing like any smartphonebattery issue all time live 2 time recharge depend on worked now lava x8 under 9k screen size 5inch ideal for all person to carry essay in hand and pick in pocket weight is light weight not say is heavy then other phone like mi bootup is quick
the best part is multitask same time me watch video and check mail and no any issuecamera called 8mp back and front 3 mp both camera is well and video recording is good and quality u can watch in pc monitor 18inch more my review after update 502 os i am say to if u want buy this mobile u can do
first of all a big thanks to flipkart
it has lots of of problem in it like camera crashes sometimes 410video plaback lava has option for smooth video playback just because of this option video plays faster than real speed and audio delaysgaming i had install asphalt 8 on it and expect awesome playback oops it lags a lot even in low qualityso basically it has graphic camera issueand please note if you are expecting camera quality just let it be
because camera quality is tooooooooo bad
and you noticed it has octa core processor with 2 gb of ram
really
crappy keyboard and its sensitivity the keyboard is such crappy that i am barely able to write single word without punctuation
capital letters coming without caps lock in case of google hindi input english words or numbers get printed in between
delete function fails
even punctuation selection goes wrong with touch
it has the worst resistivity in terms of keyboard gesture and pattern unlock
many of times it impossible to unlock phone with pattern
poorest quality charger the charger provided is of so cheap quality
we have to keep check on the mobile connection with charger every 5 to 10 minutes
even with small air flow the connection disappears
cant even image charging mobile in moving automobile
the usb port at charger end and micro usb port at mobile phone are so unusual and of non standard size and quality that doesnt fix at all
unusual phone behaviour when connected to charger the cursor behaves unusual when charger is connected
the unlock pattern is hard to use when phone connected
first of kind mobile which doesnt work with charger
apps behavior with minimum apps after resetting mobile the apps unusual behaviour observed
most of apps gets hang or gets rebooted
overall performance all together feels like driving ferrari at speed of bicycle
with 2 gigs ram octacore processors even china lowest cost substandard smart phone can beat this phone in its performance
with over 50 mbps internet speed on mobile device apps struggle to work
foolish standard instructions were provided while giving grivience feedback
after listening to the instructions feels that we should use phone in standard laboratory conditions to achieve minimum guaranteed performance with all due precautions
cdma sim doesnt work
the cdma sim slot doesnt work at all however the sim works with other handsets battery backup with the new phone i have used only wifi no sim card inserted mode for first day
and with internet browsing experience battery performance was way below benchmark
with every minute of surfing the battery reduces 1
with this draining speed i could have managed to use phone for approximately 55 minutes from 100 charged battery
with steaming media file or storage media files the battery performance is expected to be more deteriorated
touch resistive touch seems to be very slow with octacore processor and 2 gb of ram
sensitivity was below expectations
notifications with facebook push notification the phone behaves unusual
it picks up any random music files from the storage and plays that
with my phone i have few voice recordings which are being played with any fb notification
it was embarrassing using the phone with such unusual behavior
i like this phone for 1 its look 2 screen hd display 3 processor speed 4 fasted internet access compare to my dell laptop ipad mini samsunge wave ii and my kids micromax p200 tablets
plus its charger and data cable are with indian standard means built to stay longer
not listing all but it have many more things to appreciate
love to lava
i wanted to buy a smartphone strictly under inr 700000
after applying the dasara offers i got this mobile for inr 674900
i purchased on 19oct2015 and the product was delivered asap on 21oct2015 and before the estimated time 27oct2015
lava iris x8 has been really excellent one for the price ive chosen
i was expecting 4g enabled but thats ok im not in dire need of it anyway
clarity and sound has been just right without any issues
really cool one
if you are looking to buy a smart phone under inr 700000 then dont think anymore
just buy this lava iris 8 of course at the time you buy this product it should also have the associated offers though great thanks
im using this phone since last one monththis is actually a phone which is value for moneycamera quality is ok front camera is not so goodflash is enough to take pic at low light sound quality is not at all goodrest phone is fine not hanging not lagging applications are running very smoothly

n durability810overall 8510yu yurekaoverall8taking into consideration the pros n consdesign and availabilitythe lava irs x8 is a better alternate to the yu yureka
i went ahead with this purchase after a colleague of mine said nice things about the phone as he also owns
the delivery was fast i received a free flip cover which was a good deal or else i would have had to spend extra bucks for it
coming into the unpacking the phone box was completely sealed and up on opening saw the beautiful 5 inch white color phone
along with it a scratch guard is also present which again is a good thing as one does not again needs to spend extra money on it
as soon as i got my hands on the phone i removed the back cover to place the sim
there are couple of sim slots 1 marked with gsm secondary sim and other with wcdma primary sim
without checking the manual i had difficulties opening up the sim slot but later found the small hook if released unlocks the sim
initially placed the sim in the gsm slot and to my surprise after switching on found only the edge to work
i was disappointed and thought the problem could be with the sim card which was cut using a sim cutter
then i tried my luck in the other sim slot wcdma and boom 3g starts working
later checking the specs it is clearly mentioned that only primary slot has the 3g capabilities
this was weird to say the least
coming to the featurestouchscreen the touch is very average and less said the better
initially i thought the lagging could be due to the scratch guard but even removing it the touch sensitivity was just averagesound since the speaker is present in the back when the phone is placed lying on it back and when someone rings you you could hardly hear the sound
the sound is very feeble and it has forced me to place the phone on its display just to hear the sound bettercamera again camera is just average and noting more write aboutperformance i have been using it for around 10 days and already have found apps hanging videos stopping in between
may be the phone needs to be restarted once a week at leastbattery battery is the only good thing i have seen with the phone till overall i could have done little more research rather than just taking my colleagues word and blindly buying it
if you are looking for a phone around 10k budget my suggestion would be check for some alternate brands or extend the budget a little and go for better brands
good onegood battery backupno lags very fast out of 2gb ram more than 1gb would be available for use
good screen
good call quality
good music qualitygood to hold
no problem in running graphics rich games
octa corecamera quality is good
about device after using it for about 20 days i can say the device justify the cost
pros superb look some of my friends asks if am owning an iphnexcellent build quality excellent ram management about 12 gb remains free after installation of 50 appsgood colour reproductionsmooth and responsive touchfast charging conscamera quality will definitely disappoint the pic loversbattery backup is not as good as expected from 2500 mahsound quality is good but a bit low
overall its a satisfactory device for entry level users but if you dont have a tight budge go for other options like galaxy s3 neo lenovo a7000 huawei 4x
i ordered this phone since i was not able to place orders of fake flash sales of lenovo micromax yureka
but now i think i made the right choice
i am writing this review after 7 days usage of phone pros speed excellantui very goodbattery very good i have not tried heavy graphic games though cons front camera is not good is of vga quality final verdict go for it
you are getting i phone looks in 9000 rswhat else is required guys
prosgood builtgood battery performancevalue for moneyattractive design awaiting the intelligent flip cover with window consusing black color the backside colour is coming off from edges so white would look disastercamera though 10mp is pretty decent but auto focus is not consistenttouch response is a bit weird while using keyboard feels sometimes its not pressing the right button this phone was bought out of a rebound of not getting yureka so not complaining but that is a strong competitor in terms of specs
this phone is absolutely worth the money all the promised features are excellentstarting off the build quality is fine although the back case is not so sturdythe display is crisp and the pixel density is up to the mark
the brightness under sunlight provides enough visibilityviewing angles are also goodthe sound is loud enough through the speakercamera is impressive in outdoor conditions indoor conditions are not that great
one little thing is that the charger that came with the box fused immediately as i plugged into the outlet so guys take precaution while you first plug in the phone
the charger is replaceable but in any chance it bursts it will be another case
about the ui after a while of using miui i found it not so awesome
its not that user friendly but for basic users that might be enough
but being a power user i decided to switch to a custom rom
i reached this decision because miui 7 for redmi 2 prime is still kitkat not lollipop
you might ask whats the big deal if we are to receive immediate security patches and updates miui should be updated
also their unwillingness to help the android developers by releasing the firmware and kernel also made me hate them more
but after around 3 months of testing and developmenta stable rom based on aosp lollipop is released which perfoms faster and better than miui
so think before you start sticking to the miui also onne great advantage mi provides is that software is unlocked so you can retain warranty even if your device has software issues on custom rom all you have to do is flash back to miuiloving the phone not the company 7510
redmi phone is the good but have some problem1st phone overheating while i put in chargethen 2nd battery is not quality because charge in not stay in minimum one hour
hi i brought this phone on feb 1st and been using this since then
the plastic feels a little let down but the finish is good enough
overall the phone is good i had some issue with touch even the home and back screens responds slowly
some of the videos i loaded from my old sd card do not play battery is a huge let down for me my sister gets a better deal i just use whatsap and fb
i also noticed the piece has issue with heating especially when i use apps like face book otr watch videos but the good this it cools down fast as well
i know the are piece based and if you get a good piece you are lucky or else
but over all a good deal to buy
unhappy with performance
company has to more work for better performance of product
otherwise its absolute from indian market
i purchase it within rs6500 from flipkart
only problem i am getting is that the phone start getting hot when play games or browsing internet for more then 2030 minutes from the upper back and screen start flickering
first of all as usual flipkart service is awesome timely delivery good packaging
regarding the product performance wise phone is very good no hang problem
has some vibration issue vibration is equivalent to no thats why given 3 stars because is very important feature of a cellphone
this problem is in all redmi 2 phones otherwise phone is pretty much fine
only camera clarity is bad like a 5 mega pixel
other than mobile is fantastic
battery is little bit disappointed
good buy in this price rangeafter 3months of use i am writing this reviewprosgood batteryno hanguser friendlynice user interfaceconsbattery drains when large mkv files saved in sd cardan yellow spot appeared on left side of screen
battery backup is not so good camera quality is more than average over all its a very good specification under this price range
good packing quality from mi but poor packing from flipkart compared with previous delivery not satisfiednot satisfied with delivery person
good in price worth have this cell speed is not so good but overall best in price model i have took pic best looking
the mobile is quite good but it has no no support if it breaks down
i suggest to buy a phone with service center in your vicinity
above average phone
good one in this price rear camera 710front camera 8510os takes too much ram only 600700 mb for use
redmi 2 mobail is good working slime nice product thanks to 2gb ram and 16gb rom everything is smooth no lags
sound is also good with good volume
extraordinary piece but functions after few days gets delayed time taken tomprocess is bit highergood product
display gets blurred and shows color lines like old televisionotherwise phone battery and performance is good
good mobile but worst display in the category it is almost impossible to see display in sunlight
lenovo 6000 display far far better
redmi 2 prime phone good but with no ear phone assesoryhe is a bad news for redmi 2 prime earphone all compny awailebal but redmi 2 prime no availabel i sugestion you ear phone compulsoryi have a 5 pic purshes redmi 2 prime phone
fast and efficient hope it keeps on working the same way
browser friendly budget phone and value for moneyminor drawback is mi account which connects you to cloud
you may avoid it though
a decent phone in the price range of 7 k
consider improving front camera quality
a carl zeiss lens will be great
moreover no earphones are provided with this phone which is definitely a demerit
xiaomi earphones are quite costly out there and the common man expects the company to provide the enhancements along with the product
battery drained immediately after charging we received instruction to upgrade some software from cc people when we put for cancellation
now its ok
true feedback after use of 10 days pros smooth touchfast chargingapplications run without lag ive tried running heavy games it works finescreen is brightgood sound qualitysupport high end hd videos alsoxiaomis ui is good allows to do few more customization unlike stock android phones like moto g series etcinternal memory is adequate 16gb
to store videos and songssize of the phone47 is fine makes it handy and hence a unisex phonecall recording facility d without any external app
cons both front and rear cameras are not impressive
ive seen lenovo phones in this range they have better picture clarity be it night or daybattery drains like anything if youre using on 3g or running games even for an hour
for a phone with good specifications it should have better battery power
so if youre gaming geek or a normal 3g user get a power banksince it is light weight phone smooth but that slips out of hand sometimes
so i suggest get a good cover which gives it a protectionit doesnt up come with earphones to enjoy the music on the go
so i had to buy one
overall i find this phone amazingflipkart delivered it on time with nice packing
i am writing this review after using redmi prime for more than 1 monthas every coin has two sideseven every phone has pros and conscoming to the pros the phone has got a very good specifications in itits large 16gb rom makes sure that you dont need to worry for free space2gb ram works fine with around 500 mb of free rammiui is more than awesome it has got very good themes in it and i is very smooth at most timescamera is good with microshots while ok for macro shotsfront camera is ok ok onecoming to consheating problemyeah it heats up a lotlast but not the least the back panel is some what slippery but can be managed when we put on a back case
hii am happy to buy it from flipkart
service from flipkart is very good
coming to phone its a very bad experience for me
after buying phone in less than a 2 months it has fell down from a very low height and screen has badly damaged
after this i contacted service centre and response from them is very bad
the guy in store is speaking rude
he is saying its ur mistake why are you coming here and asking
and now it costs 2800 for glass
apart from this everything is fine
now iam using mi2primeits gud mobile but it getting more than 45 degrees heat while on using net movies and charging
good thingsproviding more features at affordable ratesmooth functioning bad thingsget heated little bit more than normal samsungs phonerear and front camera are not upto the mark as a 8mp should beservice centers are not giving fast solution to their xiomi customers rather the customers have to wait a lots of days
pretty good features battery backup sound quality is goodvideo resolution is not that much higher what i expected hanged 34 times in 10 days lots of updates of high memory
after 2 weeks full use the device overall performing well whenever im having mkv
video files in my device the device gets heated and also drains battery super fastly
how can i fix the problem
best mobile phone in this budget
camera sound display everything excellent
no major heating issueservice by flipkart getting worse day by dayit took more than a week to reach me via speedpost
cell is awesome but is has no anti theft protection
we could not track if we lost it
theft secqurity is more important but it hasnt
i got this mobile on august 19 it was awesome product at this price
the mobile was functioning very well and specs were good with 2gb ram and 16 gd rom qualcom quad core processor
but a week before i see white lines on the screen mobile was not subjected to any physical damaged
nice phone but network issues sometimes the network is not their when u make a call you cant hear anything you need to restart your phone and then make a call
phone is quite good in term of specificationcamera
qulity is amazing the only problem with this phone is it get heat up quicklyafter using for 4 month the touch is responding late
my redmi 2 prime battery draining so fast
i just bought 1 week before
at night there is 90 but next day when i woke up find 20 battery without any usage even flight mode it happen
some apps like freecharge paytm are not working the payment site i not working and a error comes on the web pagethemes
can be downloaded only when wifi is connected ad same for software updateuser
iterface no doubt very goodram is not true 2 gb when i got the new phone near about 1gb was already usedmy phone does not heat up but my frnd had that proble but after replaceent it was okcan buy for this price its worth
pro fast delivery by flipkart
cons mentioned camera 8mp however quality of 3 mp poor camerainternet not working on phone
just an average phone
no leader in its range
cutting the chase short lets directly head to the major points prosabsolute delight to hold in hand
sleek and stylishdisplay touch app handling perfectocamera works pretty cool in good lightingsunlight but not that great insidegames
work well with no lag and frame dropsmiui rocks and a huge score over the rest android improvisation
consmajor heating while gaming but i guess its there with all other brand devicessince the app data is not movable to sd card there is some memory constraints toono
warranty card in box
yes this phone has double the storage and ram but honestly saying this is not as good as redmi 2 reasons 1 the screen saturation issue of screen
the screen making bright and dull saturtions after i off the screen and then turn on
this thing is happening in all other redmi prime 2 as i reviewed there comment in mi official site
2 battery backup is not as goodthey need to go for a 2500 battery otherwise this is a flop
other software issues are there but i dont care for those as they got corrected via update so software is not a major issue
best mobile under 7000 rs but its have a heating problem and also not work in data connection properly
they said we could take a new connection or swap the existing airtel simbut the sim they gave could only get swappedsuch a scam and now they removed the offer alsobut the phone is goodredmi 2 prime awesome m
for this price you cant expect more from this phone
what they have give good ok
who want good camara and good battrie is not preferable
speaker are good and touch is also ok smooth running ofcourse
but for the basic and general use only
i have used it for 2 days nowand i can say that all is coolexcept speakers in the devicethey are too tiny and sound output is very very lowyou simply cant watch a song oir a video with built in speakers
the phone has heating issues while calling and charging
while the phone is good but the battery back up is really very bad due to the heating issues
it is impossible to play any graphic intensive games
consmy mobile is getting heated when i use internet it is absorbing surrounding heat and getting heated up while i kept ideally in my pocketspeed is less compared to redmi 1scam quality is worse for cam lovers it is worst mobile is weight and its nice features arevery compatable while usingnot getting hangbattery is good while using continuously internet and games
sometime playing game suddenly stop and network issue on browsing with wifi litlle bit heating problem when playing candcrush and other hiend game other then phone is great
internet connection does not work properly on 3g phone gets heat upbattery back up is not good
